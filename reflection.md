## The Hardest Part 🤯

Hmmm... GitHub was a bit challenging... Mostly nginx was simple until I got to the ip-hash task, geting it to pass my tests, and creating a functioning testing script proved far more challenging... 😅
\
I had to update the python testing files names and the code to match python3,
and then update the GitHub workflows yml file to not get stuck listening endlessly... 🙄
\
Then I had to adjust my testing script to verify that everything is running smoothly. 😉

## What I Learned 🤓

I learned that setting up load balancing is far easier and quicker in Nginx then in AWS 🤣
\
I also learned a lot of new ways to design a `.md` file 😊
\
I learned a whole new advanced world of testing bash scripts... 😂

## Fun Moments 😄

Making the custom HTML and .md files was a lot of fun! 😂
